# quantitative-portfolio-management

Quantitative Portfolio Management Project, NYU Tandon 10/2016
• Extracted and managed historical data of 12 ETFs, sorting out returns and covariance matrix in R
• Applied non-linear optimization algorithm, built portfolios based on controlled levels of portfolio beta (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) to get the maximum cumulative returns over different periods (30 days, 90 days, 180 days)
• Performed the bootstrap protocol for resampling, generated new data set with normal distributed returns of same mean and variance as the real data and validated the model with new data set
• Modified models by adjusting the weights of return and risk in the model (by adjusting the coefficient of the optimization formula)
